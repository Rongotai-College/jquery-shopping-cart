jQuery Shopping Cart: An option for anonymous login
---

- This sample uses replacement text and images
- Each item card can be developed into overlays with additional product info
- The image carousel can (and should) be developed to suit


### Main Idea
This design can be included with a website where login/register option is available but provides an option where users can still browse and shop if they do not want to leave their details with a company on their servers.
